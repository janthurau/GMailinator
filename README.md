# GMailinator

Adds Gmail-esque keyboard shorcuts to Mail.app.  This is still very much a work
in progress.  Tested with Mail for OS X Catalina.

## How to install

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to it in your terminal
2. Enable Mail.app plugins (stop Mail.app if it's running):
       `defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles -bool true`
3. run `xcodebuild` (make sure you actually have xcode installed)
4. run `mv ./build/Release/GMailinator.mailbundle ~/Library/Mail/Bundles`
5. start mail app, open settings -> plugins -> activate it.
6. restart mail app :)

## Credits

A lot of this was built with heavy use of of the
[BindDeleteKeyToArchive](https://github.com/benlenarts/BindDeleteKeyToArchive)
project by Ben Lenarts.  The Xcode project and interface skeleton were
all from that project, and for the most part, renamed.  I added the keybinding code.

A lot of the code is also either copied in whole, or modified from the
Nostalgy4Mail.app project, by [Hajo Nils
Krabbenh√∂ft](https://github.com/fxtentacle/Nostalgy-4-Mail.app), and
subsequently by [Jelmer van der
Linde](https://github.com/jelmervdl/Nostalgy-4-Mail.app). I've added support
for ARC (turns out there were quite a few leaks), and prettied-up (imho) the
move-to-folder dialog.
